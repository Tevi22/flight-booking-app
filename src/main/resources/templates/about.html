        <p>
            <strong>TevinAir</strong> is a fictional airline booking web application developed by
            <strong>Tevin Davis</strong> for the IT 634 Distributed Application Development course at Southern New Hampshire University.
        </p>

        <p>
            This application represents the <strong>final project</strong> for the course and demonstrates the design and implementation of a full-stack, distributed web application using modern Java and Spring Boot technologies. TevinAir allows users
            to search for flights, securely book reservations, view booking history, and cancel bookings with real-time seat availability updates.
        </p>

        <p>
            The system integrates a RESTful backend with a server-rendered frontend, backed by a relational database to persist flight and booking data. Emphasis was placed on modular architecture, separation of concerns, transaction safety, and realistic airline-style
            user workflows.
        </p>

        <h4 class="mt-4">System Architecture Overview</h4>

        <p>
            TevinAir follows a layered, distributed architecture based on the
            <strong>Model–View–Controller (MVC)</strong> design pattern. User interactions are handled by Spring MVC controllers, which delegate business logic to service-layer components. These services expose RESTful operations and interact with a persistent
            data layer using Spring Data JPA.
        </p>

        <p>
            The frontend is rendered using Thymeleaf templates, which consume data provided by controllers and present dynamic, server-side HTML views. All flight and booking data is stored in a MySQL relational database, ensuring durability and consistency across
            user sessions and application restarts.
        </p>

        <p>
            Transactional boundaries are enforced at the service layer to guarantee data integrity, particularly for booking creation and cancellation workflows where seat availability must remain synchronized.
        </p>

        <h4 class="mt-4">Future Improvements</h4>

        <p>
            Potential future enhancements for TevinAir include support for round-trip bookings, passenger class selection, pricing tiers, and integration with a live third-party flight data provider. Additional security improvements such as Spring Security, token-based
            authentication, and role-based access control could further strengthen the application for real-world deployment.
